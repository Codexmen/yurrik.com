  <PageTitle title="About me"/>
  <p>Hey there! I&#x27;m Yurii Kovalenko, a frontend developer since
    2010 originally from Melitopol, UkraineðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦. Presently, I&#x27;m residing in Poland ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± due to the Russian-Ukrainian
    war.</p>
  <p>There I try to enhance my writing skills and share my
    experiences.</p>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>My journey in development began during my school days, evolving
    from a hobby into my full-time profession. I embarked on my career as a full stack developer using PHP, spending
    several years developing numerous portals and e-commerce platforms.</p>
  <p>Transitioning to a more Frontend-focused role, I&#x27;ve spent
    the last decade primarily immersed in JavaScript and popular frameworks like React and Vue. Throughout my journey, I&#x27;ve
    encountered numerous frameworks and libraries, some of which have faded from memory, such as JQuery, Backbone, and
    Angular 1+.</p>
  <p>I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to step into leadership roles a
    few times, and I&#x27;m currently expanding my skill set by delving into Python and various data-related topics.
    This venture also serves as a platform for me to enhance my writing skills and share my experiences.</p>
  <p>A dedicated enthusiast for learning, I&#x27;m constantly seeking
    new experiences and knowledge. Beyond the tech realm, I indulge in various hobbies such as snowboarding, sailing,
    music, traveling, cooking, and more.</p>
