    <p>Hey there! My name is Yurii Kovalenko. I am a frontend developer since 2010 from Melitopol, Ukraine.</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>First steps in development I made in school. From that time it is my hobby and full-time  job.

      I started my career as a full stack developer on PHP and it finished by creating in-house CMS on YIi.</p>
    <p>After that I changed my job and focused mostly on frontend. There is a lot of frameworks and libraries that I already forgot like JQuery, Backbone, Angular 1+. </p>
    <p>Last years I am working with  React and Vue.</p>
    <p>A few times was promoted to lead position.</p>
    <p>Learning  Python and Data related topics.</p>
    <p>Big fan of learning and curious to new experience and knowledge.</p>
    <p>I have a lot of hobbies not related to tech like snowboarding, sailing, music, traweling, cooking and more others.</p>
